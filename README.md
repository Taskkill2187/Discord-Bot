# Discord-Bot

This is an easily modifyable Bot that is meant to run on multiple Servers.

His Program.cs will automaticly register all Command-Childs in his assembly so feel free to add your own Commands.
However: Please don't use Discord.NET's Send-Methods directly, the Wrappers in Program.cs exist for a reason.
